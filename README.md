# LatencyAnalysis Project README

## Status: Work in Progress

The LatencyAnalysis project is currently in development, with a focus on refining and ensuring the correctness of its functionalities. The team is actively working on various aspects, and this README serves as a guide to understand the ongoing tasks, responsibilities, and collaboration within the team.

## Review Existing Documentation (Phillipp)

Please review the current README.md to gain insights into existing plans and the project's status. Identify any artifacts, such as diagrams and design documents, that might be useful for understanding the project's structure and goals.

## Team Task Assignment (Jason and Phillipp)

Assign tasks and responsibilities within the team. Jason will focus on Design and Code Correctness, while Phillipp will be responsible for JavaDoc Comments and Documentation. Collaborate on UML diagram updates, code correctness, JavaDoc comments, and JUnit tests.

## Design and Code Correctness (Jason)

- Validate that helper methods in LatencyVisualization and latency analysis are public for testing purposes.
- Add comments to clearly indicate private or protected methods.
- Ensure the code adheres to design principles and meets project requirements.

## JavaDoc Comments and Documentation (Phillipp)

- Add JavaDoc comments to classes and methods, documenting the purpose of LatencyVisualization and latency analysis.
- Update README.md or other documentation files with any new information.

## JUnit Tests (Jason)

- Develop comprehensive JUnit tests for LatencyVisualization and VisualizationAnalysis.
- Write tests to cover various latency scenarios and ensure they include different scenarios and edge cases.
- Document test cases and expected outcomes.

## Review and Collaboration (Jason and Phillipp)

- Collaborate on reviewing each other's work in LatencyAnalysis and LatencyAnalysisTest.
- Ensure consistency across documentation, code, and tests.

## Finalize and Commit (Jason and Phillipp)

- Make necessary revisions based on feedback for LatencyAnalysis and LatencyAnalysisTest.
- Commit changes to the repository and merge as needed.

## Communication (Jason)

- Clearly communicate the completion of tasks and any outstanding issues related to LatencyAnalysis and LatencyAnalysisTest.
- Provide updates in team meetings or communication channels.

## Verify Artifacts (Phillipp)

- Confirm that all required artifacts, including diagrams and documents, are updated and accessible.

Thank you for your dedication and contributions to the LatencyAnalysis project. Let's work collaboratively to ensure the success of the project.
